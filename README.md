##python-bank-polling-analysis

Created by: Miguel Diaz 
as part of U of T's Data Bootcamp.

The goal of this project is to use python code to go through the datasets provided in the Resources files. 

The PyBank budget_data.csv data set contains month to month profit/loss data of a company. 
From that dataset the total months on record is found, the absolute value of changes, the average change each month, as well as the best and worst months on record. 

The PyPoll data set has the voting info of people of different counties, voter id, their county and the candidate they voted for. 
From this dataset the votes for each candidate were tallied, the percentage of the total votes each got, the total votes and the winner of the election. 

The results of these analyses are printed by the script and on to a txt file in the corresponding folder.
